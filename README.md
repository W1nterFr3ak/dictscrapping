# Problem 3: Diction & dictionary scrapping.

# Webscrap

Webscrap is a script that scrapes a webpage and gets the word count of unique words. It also compares words of two web pages when given a compare argument and another webpage url and displays both the percentage similarity of both pages to each other and similar words.  
** -u or â€“url ** only Below is the output of the code when only one url is passed without the verbose options which limits the words displayed to the 10 most occurring words in the page. If verbose is passed all the words and their counts will be displayed.
